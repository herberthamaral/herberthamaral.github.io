<p>Since Django 1.4 it is possible to use project templates. This means that you can start off your Django project
with a different project structure, which also means that you can avoid some initial configuration hassle.</p>

<p>Django follows Python&rsquo;s principle of &ldquo;explicit is better than implicit&rdquo;. And this is the justification I&rsquo;ve got when I
asked why Django does not have some configurations done by default. I think &ldquo;convention over configuration&rdquo; is not
necessarily &ldquo;explicit is better than implicit&rdquo;&rsquo;s enemy. Both can live together as long you keep the configurations
explicit.</p>

<p>Thinking about that I&rsquo;ve decided to write a project template which eliminates some of the Django&rsquo;s annoyances when
starting a project, mainly related to paths (templates, media and static). This is specially useful for newcomers so
they don&rsquo;t lose a lot of time configuring the project.</p>

<h3>Show me it working!</h3>

<p>You can start off a project using this template like this:</p>

<pre>
$ django-admin.py startproject myproject \
  --template=https://github.com/herberthamaral/django_project_template/archive/master.zip
$ cd myproject
$ python manage.py runserver
</pre>


<p>At this point you can point out your browser to <code><a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a></code> and you can see Django&rsquo;s initial
page. But, if you point it to <code><a href="http://localhost:8000/static/readme.txt">http://localhost:8000/static/readme.txt</a></code>, you can also see the static folder&rsquo;s
configuration working. The same for the media folder: <code><a href="http://localhost:8000/media/readme.txt">http://localhost:8000/media/readme.txt</a></code>.</p>

<p>The template path is also configured. And there is a example template located in
<code>myproject/templates/index.html</code>. Yup, it is the initial Django&rsquo;s template, slightly modified.</p>

<h3>Limitations and workarounds</h3>

<p>Not everything is a sea of roses, though:</p>

<ul>
<li>Django does not offer a way to change the project folder name. For that reason, I&rsquo;ve been forced to add a custom code
in manage.py in order to change this folder name to match the application name.</li>
<li>There is some extra code in urls.py too.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Final words</h3>

<p>I hope this can solve some problems for newcomers willing to learn Django. Please <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a>
